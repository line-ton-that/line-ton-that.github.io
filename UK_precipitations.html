        Will climate change bring more rain to the UK ?

      <p>
        The UK is quite famous for its rainy weather. Then a simple question occurring
        to me was whether climate change would make it worse or not.
        To answer this question, historical data were compared with projections for
        the period 2080-2099.
      </p>

      <h2>Annual precipitations are likely to increase</h2>

    <section class="scrolly" id="scrolly">

      <article>

        <div class="step" data-step="1">
          <p>
            The average annual precipitations observed in the UK from
            1991 to 2016 are 1,244&nbsp;mm.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-step="2">
          <p>
            According to the worst-case scenario for climate change ("RCP&nbsp;8.5"),
            the <span class="projected">projected precipitations</span> in the UK for the period 2080-2099 are
            <span class="projected">1,304&nbsp;mm</span>.

        </div>

        <div class="step" data-step="3">
          <p>
            Comparing the results shows that forecast annual precipitations will increase by 61&nbsp;mm,
            which is a <span class="rainier">4.9%&nbsp;increase</span>.

        </div>

    </section>


    <section class="generic" id="endAnnual">

      <p>Then, the answer to the initial question is "yes":
        Climate change will likely bring more rain to the UK.
        A 4.9% increase seems like a rather small overall change.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the overall amount of precipitation over the year does not allow us to deduce the variation in precipitation over the seasons. Since precipitation varies over the year, we suspect that the increase in precipitation is not spread evenly over the year. If this is not the case, what would the pattern be?
      </p>

      <h2>Changes in precipitation patterns are likely to vary from month to month</h2>

            Now, if we have a look at the monthly <span class="projected">projected precipitations</span>, we realize

        What would be the consequences of these changes in monthly rainfall for the UK?
        Let's look at monthly variations in details.

      <h2>The consequences could be longer dry spells and increased risks of floodings</h2>

          <p>
            The 4.9% increase observed on an annual basis can be broken down

            During months with <span class="drier">less rain</span>, it could mean <span class="drier">longer dry spells</span> impacting sectors

      <h2>Considering rainfall intensity and variability between years</h2>
      <p>
        The monthly precipitations alone do not provide the full picture,
        as <b>rain intensity</b> is critical to understand the impact of rain on
        human activities. The number of days with <b>rainfall above 20 mm</b> would
        also be a useful indicator, since 20 mm is the threshold beyond which
        precipitations are considered very heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>variability in precipitations</b> is <b>quite high</b>, and monthly precipitations
        from one year to another might vary significantly. Therefore, even though
        monthly precipitations are projected to increase during certain months,
        it doesn't mean that during these months, there will always be more rain
        than what was observed historically.
      </p>

      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p>
        Here, the median of the results from an ensemble of climate change models has been
        used, after reading on the Climate Knowledge Portal that: "The median is a fairly
        robust measure as it reduces the lower quality simulations of precipitation still
        prevalent in many models". This means that 1/ uncertainty is fairly high when it
        comes to the results of the models, and 2/ if we need to consider the worst-case
        scenario, we should <b>directly use the models that result in worst-case situations</b>
        for the UK, not only the median of the results from all the models.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another limitation is that we consider the UK as a whole, while climatic
        conditions have <b>spatial variability</b> as well. Regional rainfall are for
        example influenced by the distance to the Atlantic Ocean and latitude.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Back to the initial question: Yes, climate change is projected to bring more rain to the UK on average by the end of the 21st century (4.9% increase). The rainfall pattern is also expected to change over the year, and this could potentially
        lead to more intense rainfall, and longer dry spells.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further investigations would be needed to better understand the potential impacts on human activities, especially in worst-case scenarios. These investigations should in particular include rainfall intensity, spatial variability, and the
        climate change models considered.
